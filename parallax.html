       in the US, the word city is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America,
       they gave the name "city" to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt
       Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town they made street plans and
       called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city.
